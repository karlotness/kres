# kres LaTeX Template

This repository contains the LaTeX class files that I use to format my
resume. The `.cls` file and the documentation PDF are built with
`make`.

`make install` will place the generated class file under `TEXMFHOME`.

This project is under the MIT license. See LICENSE.txt for the license
text.

## Dependencies
This class file is designed to work under a TeXLive distribution. It
depends on:

- `article`
- `fontenc`
- `hyperref`
- `navigator`
- `libertine`
- `multicol`
- `microtype`
- `xstring`
- `changepage`
- `xparse`
- `ifthen`

All of these packages should be included in a standard TeXLive
distribution.
